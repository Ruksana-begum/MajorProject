## steps follow to execute the code:

# here we used google Collab firstly login collab and create a folder next paste the code in cells line by line after 
at point of  kaggle_credentials:Firstly create kaggle account and in settings section u will findout json file u need to upload kaggle.json file which is available in ur account and run cells again same way
Finally at imagepath first u need to upload all images in ur drive ![drive](https://github.com/Ruksana-begum/PlantDiseaseDetection-MP/assets/127771632/7884362d-1f0c-48d1-801b-1e525f58ed53)
 and run after that 


## After that open the main.py file in and change the path and open after that enter all the required packages into the system
CMD:enter your file path
next enter upto file path upto app
eg:"E:\Alpha\plant\plant-disease-prediction-cnn-deep-leanring-project-main\app"
enter streamlit run main.py and enter localhost will be open then u upload the image and classify the disease which is detected to the plant
