# steps follow to execute the code:

here we used google Collab firstly login collab and create a folder next paste the code in cells line by line after 
at point of  kaggle_credentials:Firstly create kaggle account and in settings section u will findout json file u need to upload kaggle.json file which is available in ur account and run cells again same way
Finally at imagepath first u need to upload all images in ur drive 
 and run after that 


After that open the main.py file in and change the path and open after that enter all the required packages into the system
CMD:enter your file path
next enter upto file path upto app
eg:"E:\Alpha\plant\plant-disease-prediction-cnn-deep-leanring-project-main\app"
enter streamlit run main.py and enter localhost will be open then u upload the image and classify the disease which is detected to the plant


## Screenshots of the output

## 1.Now we will observe some of the images that are their in our dataset.
